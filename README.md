# Law-Firm

This is my first freelance project, which I completed for my client, a lawyer, and I'm happy to report that he was really pleased with the results. I wanted to make it appear both contemporary and timeless because law should always have a classic feel to it. 
You won't be able to perform CRUD operations on this project because it is connected to an API hosted on CPanel which only client has access to; instead, you will only be able to view the blogs that the author (in this case, my client), once he makes them, has written. 
Please feel free to browse the pages or send emails (a dummy email is used in this development mode) to see the design that I created. CMS was built by myself with NodeJS and React. This project is READ only.
